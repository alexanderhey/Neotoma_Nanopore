These scripts take your intitial input .fasta of target windows and mask them with a custom script. Check publication for full citation from the custom script.
the third script identifies how many of your nucleotides were converted to N's. 
In my case, I removed one window that had high levels of repeats and was shown on 
previous runs to be taking up a lot of reads.
In any case, the window was removed and a final output file was created for enrichment, filtered_40kb_loci.nuc.mito.fasta
